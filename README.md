# Weather-App
I developed a responsive weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrating the OpenWeatherMap API for real-time data. The app shows current weather, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and sunrise/sunset times. Features include an 8-day forecast, day/night mode, real-time clock, and embedded Google Map.
